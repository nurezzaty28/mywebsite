<br> It was the last semester break of my diploma. Me and my other friends decided to go to short trip at Rumah Ndoi, Baling, Kedah.
<br> We stay for 2days and 1night but for me it was very best moment or experience to me. After that, we also went to Baling Hotspring. 
<br>For us, enjoying hotspring water at night will heal all of the stress. The next day, we wake up early to go the
<br> "Tiptop Corner" which is they sell "Roti Canai" in variety of choices for breakfast. Customers can choose to add on cheese or not.
<br>The price is very cheap with that kind of taste. There are many outside people come to breakfast at this stall.

<br> This is the best experience with my friends because, all of us not come from Kedah and it more difficult to meet them because of this pandemic. 
<br>But all of us manage to spend a little quality time and still make sure we follow all the SOP to avoid spreading or infected by Covid-19.
<br> Even it was the short trip but all of us still enjoying the moment. We only have a few months before this last semester end, 
<br>so we manage to spend the time before we all split up and follow each other's choices whether to work or continue studying.

<br>I really recommend to those who want to do camping thing at Rumah Ndoi because it is the right place for people that love the nature. 
<br>All of us just sleep in the tent that can fit 2 people.It was very cool moment for me cause need to fight with some insect like mosquito and ant.
<br> At the night we just chilling at the place by playing some games, story time and drinking coffee. The vibe very suit for people to chill with family and friends.
