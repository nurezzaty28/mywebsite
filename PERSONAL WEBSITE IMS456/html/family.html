<br>First of all, my hero which is my father.He has passed away in 2018 and it was a month after I got the offer to study at UiTM. He used to worked as a teacher.  
<br>He already sacrifice a lots to my family. After that, is about my one & only mother.
<br>We called she as"Ibu". She such a strongest women, i ever meet. Since my father passed away, she is the one who will ensure that everything enough for me and my other siblings. 
<brShe was 49 years old in this year.
<p>
<br> The next is about my big brother. He already 27 years old and married. Since my dad not be here anymore, he was the one will make sure all of my siblings safe. 
<br>In my family, I'm not the only one daugther because I have one eldest sister. Now, she is 24 years old but still continue studying in UPSI. 
<br>She also the person who will always help me, if I face any problems related to my study.

<br> Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something that can be learn in school. 
<br> It was the natural feelings of comfortable with someone without reason.
<br> To enjoy the life, if you haven't learned the real meaning of friendship, it's mean you haven't learned anythings.
<br> I really thanks to all those people in the video cause will always be a good friends to me.
<br> Being single without partner is okay but you can't enjoy the journey without a good of friends.
